# 🔐 Redirect Shield – Stay Safe From Malicious Redirects & Suspicious Sites

> A powerful, privacy-first Chrome Extension that blocks shady redirects, scans websites for hidden threats, and shows users a detailed safety score for every site they visit.

---

## 🚀 Why This?

Free movie/download websites often:
- ❌ Redirect users to scam or adult websites
- ❌ Inject harmful trackers and crypto miners
- ❌ Trick users into fake downloads or virus links

⚠️ Even with Chrome’s pop-up blocker ON, these still happen!

🔐 **Redirect Shield** solves this by:
- Blocking malicious redirects
- Scanning websites for trackers, dangerous scripts, and suspicious iframes
- Showing users a transparent, human-readable safety report
- Giving each website a **Security Score**
